 Write a function FizzBuzz that takes a limit argument. The function is to print the numbers from 0 to limit in such a way that the function prints every number, unless:

- is divisible by 3 prints "Fizz" instead of the number,
- is divisible by 5 prints "Buzz" instead of the number,
- is divisible by 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

So, for limit = 16 we should get: FizzBuzz, 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16 (can be displayed on separate lines via Console.WriteLine()).
